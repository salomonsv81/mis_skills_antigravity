# DOCX Creation, Editing, and Analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit.

## Workflow Decision Tree

### Reading/Analyzing Content
- **Text extraction**: Use pandoc to convert to markdown
```bash
pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md
```

### Creating New Document
Use **docx-js** (JavaScript/TypeScript library)

### Editing Existing Document
- **Your own document + simple changes**: Basic OOXML editing
- **Someone else's document**: Use redlining workflow
- **Legal/academic/business docs**: Use redlining workflow (required)

## Key File Structures

- `word/document.xml` - Main document contents
- `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml
- `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files

## Dependencies

- **pandoc**: For text extraction
- **docx**: npm package for creating new documents
- **LibreOffice**: For PDF conversion
- **Poppler**: For pdftoppm to convert PDF to images
